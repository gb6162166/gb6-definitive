  "description": "A collection of maps by # gb6, with a definitive style and map design philosophy for Planetary Annihilation. All maps have been tested by human players, and by Penchant Ai (recommended mod). Use the 'Reverants' option in Penchant Ai for your default Ai. Red Line 2 (recommended mod) is an army expansion, also by # gb6, and is available in community mods, and plays best using this map pack.",
