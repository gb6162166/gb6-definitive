  "description": "A collection of maps by gb6, with definitive style and map design philosophy for Planetary Annihilation. All maps have been tested by human players, and are also Ai friendly. Set the Ai to Hard difficulty with economy boost of 1.2x or 1.3x so maps play at their best. Red Line 2, also by gb6, is available in community mods - a unit expansion mod designed for #gb6 maps.",
